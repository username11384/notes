Resiliant and sustainable infrastructure for the future
tunnel boring thing
concrete is bad for the environment
geopolymer concrete is better
trying to make building cities more better for the environment
taking everything back to the beginning(timber)
engineered timber is better for the environment
CLT -  cross laminated timber (glued together to replicate the strength of concrete and steel)
They want to move to using CLT instead of solid concerete and steel
It can sustain wind and earthquakes just as well as normal steel buildings
Processed offsite, putting it in was a lot easier 
15-16 floors can be made out of timber safely, most people work below level 10 anyways
So far, CLT is more expensive than steel and concrete, but the gap is closing and the price is reducing
One building can be grown in a day because of all of the plantations
Mass engineered timber will be better and more efficient than using steel. 
There are challenges to overcome
Geopolymer concrete is 30% stronger than normal concrete 
Better bond withe the aggregates.
Always testing new samples of geopolymer conc(daily basis)
Concrete takes 28 days to fully set
Mass plantations to make engineered timber
Good rainfall improves trees
30 years of growth required
Logs are graded for structural quality to make sure that they are good
Sorted by shapes and sizes and quality
Maximise output product and reduce sawdust
Raw wood is not strong enough, it needs to be turned into the tough wood
Glue laminated timber
Moved to heatless glue, cures quickly(10 mins instead of 6 hours)
Less greenhouse gasses
