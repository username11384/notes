# Persuasive Structure
---

The key to writing good extended respnses is to learn the set structure for each type of response. Yes, the structure can be bent slightly, but until you can write them fluently, its best to stick to a set structure.

##### <u>Persuasive Structure</u>
Always start your introduction with some sort of hook to get your audiences attention and then make it clear what you will be arguing. You will argue 3 points towards. your main argument, state them here and state why they matter to <u>you</u>. Address your audience. Either make a statement or write a question. Use high modality words!

Your body paragraph should either start with your first argument point or address your audience to lead into your first argument point. Next, expand on your argument and give your opinion(use personal voice). Use evidence here and persuasive devices. Talk to your audience. Come back to the point and the main argument at the end. You can also end the paragraph by talking to the audience again.

Closing paragraph should restate your points and overall argument. You need to reaffirm your position - Why is it so important to you and why your audience should give a damn. End with a high modality stance or put the focus back on your audience.

---
Always 5 paragraphs

> 1st Paragraph - Intro
> 2nd Paragraph - Strongest argument
> 3rd Paragraph - Second strongest
> 4th Paragraph - Weakest argument
> 5th Paragraph - Conclusion

## Introduction Paragraph
Intro should start with something to get the audiences attention. This is called a hook. A good example of this is a rhetorical question. A boring, but acceptable start is to state your argument
> E.g. Hook “No one likes getting up early do they?”
> E.g. Statement “School shouldn’t start at 7AM”

After your starting sentence, introduce the argument and state your position. If you use a hook to start, don’t forget to state your argument after the first sentence

> E.g. Position “I for one like things the way they are”

**Argument Examples**

> Ex. 1 “People learn better when they are well rested.”
> Ex. 2 “When people get up early they have to skip breakfast and don’t learn well on an empty stomach
> Ex.3 “School will finish early and kids will be out roaming the street.”

Round off the paragraph by talking to the audience about your topic. Use personal voice.

> E.g. “I don’t believe this is a good idea and when I’m finished neither will you”

## Body Paragraph 1
Pick the one you can argue the most to go first. First sentence, state your argument, and use personal voice with high modality words.

> E.g. “ know for a fact that people learn better when they are well rested.”
  
After that, bring in an example to strengthen your position.

> E.g. “Many kids fall asleep in class do so because they have been unable to sleep that night before. Educators at Mount Annan stated that in the classroom they can tell when a student has not slept well, as it disrupts their ability to learn. This is further supported by the research paper by E.D Clover that did a sleep study to test how children learn under interrupted sleep conditions.”


Make up research that supports your argument. When writing a piece like this, you can throw in a bunch of random bullshit to back up your argument. After that, come back to personal language.  

> E.g. “I know of kids that are just too tired to learn, imagine how worse it would be when they get less sleep”

Use persuasive devices to support your argument

> E.g. “Kids are just too tired. They are tired, I am tired, we are tired. Everyone is tired.”  

Either bring it back to the main argument or the next argument or both.

> E.g. “When we don’t sleep, we don’t learn, starting school earlier will stop us from learning, Starting school earlier will stop us from learning and will lead to other issues”

---

## Other paragraphs
Your other body paragraphs would follow the same structure. Your last sentence needs to show your audience is on track is with your argument so coming in with:

> “Children will choose to skip breakfast a bit more rather than getting up earlier and that will affect their education

---

  

## Conclusion

  

Your conclusion restates your position, NOTE, starting with the words:

> “In Conclusion”
  
is very bloody boring, and you shouldn’t do this.

> E.g. “School shouldn’t start early.....”
> E.g. "I know this because"

Use personal voice to restate your argument.

> E.g. “I have only stated three things, but I’m sure there are many more

State the main argument again and thank your audience.
