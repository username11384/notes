Recent events 
 - George Floyd
 
Explain what happened in that case with a quote from MLK's speech transcript, which is 
> “We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.”

What happened in the case of George Floyd?
- Accused for using counterfeit $20 note
- Pushed down on the floor and under a car by a white police officer
- Officer put knee on his neck, blocking his breathing
- Nobody responded to his cries for help
