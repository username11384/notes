Angles are measured in degrees, but one degree can be divided into 60 minutes
One minute can be subdivided into 60 seconds

1° = 60'           1 degree = 60 minutes
1' = 60"          1 minute = 60 seconds

E.g. 36t°32'48" degrees, 32 minutes, 48 seconds, which is about halfway between 36° and 37°

To enter degrees and minutes(and seconds) into a scientific calculator, use the DMS key

Make sure that the calculator has the D icon on the top (shift setup -> degree)
