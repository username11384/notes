Questions to ask when solving a trig question
1. What angle do I have
2. What sides do I have in relation to that angle
3. Which trig ratio should I use
Then
Write out the appropriate trig ratio with all the information from the question
And then solve it

sine = opposite over hyp
cosine = adjacent over hyp
tangent = opposite over adjacent

Examples
Find the value of the pronumeral in each triangle, crrect to two decimal places

sin 75° = $\dfrac{y}{25.3} * 25.3$

25.3 x sin 75° = y
							y = 24.43792341
							= 24.44cm

cos 50°3' = $\dfrac {v} {48.75} * 48.75$

48.75 x cos 50°3' = v
48.75 x cos 50°"3°" = 31.30321
