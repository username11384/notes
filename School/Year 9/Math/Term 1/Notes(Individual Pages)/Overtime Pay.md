## Overtime pay
- There are multiple types of overtime pay in Australia. There is double time, and time and a half. Double time is 200% of your pay and time and a half is 150% of your pay
- You get paid depending on what your employer says and when you work outside of your time schedule. For example, you work in McDonalds from 10am to 4pm, and your manager needs you to stay until 6pm. They will pay you overtime for this. 
- Overtime pay **does not** affect salary workers.

#### Examples
- Michael works for 35 hours a week with an hourly rate of $18.50. If he works 6 hours overtime at time and a half for 2 hours overtime at double time, what is his pay for the week
- Pay for the week = $883.2. You figure this out by multiplying $18.50 by 35 hours to get his base weekly pay. And then you do 6 x 18.50 x 1.5 to figure out his time and a half pay. You add the together to get $883.2
