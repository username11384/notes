## Factorising special binomial products
- Algebraic expressions with four terms can often be factorised in pairs, i.e. two terms at a time, to make a binomial product
- $10x^2 + 30 + x^3 + 3x = 10(x^2 + 3) + x(x^2 + 3)$
- = $(x^2 + 3)(10 + x)$

- $x^3 + 10x^2 + 3x + 30 = x^2(x+10) + 3(x+10)$
- = $(x+10)(x^2+3)$
