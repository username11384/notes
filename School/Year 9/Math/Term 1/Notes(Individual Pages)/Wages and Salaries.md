## Wages and salaries
- A wage is calculated from the number of hours worked and is usually paid weekly. Examples of this are retail workers, gardeners and factory workers.
- Wage earners can make some more income by working more hours(overtime)
- A salary is a fixed annual amount, paid weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Examples of this are teachers, managers, architects, police etc. 
- Salary earners do not earn overtime pay but they can recieve benefits such as a computer, company account, expense account, shares in the company or paid medical expenses

Conversion rate:
1 year = 12 months
1 fortnight = 2 weeks
1 year = 52 weeks(not exactly, a real year is 52.18 weeks for salary earners)
1 year = 26 fortnights
1 month is **NOT** 4 weeks.
