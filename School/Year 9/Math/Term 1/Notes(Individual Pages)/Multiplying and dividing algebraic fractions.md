## Multiplying and dividing algebraic fractions

- To multiply fractions, cancel any common factors, then multiply the numerators and denominators seperately. 
- To divide by a fraction $\dfrac {a}{b}$, multiply by its reciprocal $\dfrac {b}{a}$

#### Examples
- $\dfrac {3}{h} * \dfrac {5}{k}$ = $\dfrac {3 * 5}{h * k}$ 
                  = $\dfrac {15}{hk}$
- $\dfrac {k}{2} \div \dfrac {k}{8}$ =  $\dfrac {k}{2} * \dfrac {8}{k}$
				    = $\dfrac {8k}{2k}$
- Cancel out any common factors = $\dfrac {4}{1}$
