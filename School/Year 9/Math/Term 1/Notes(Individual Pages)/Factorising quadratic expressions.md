## Factorising quadratic expressions
- Factorise a quadratic expression to form a binomial product when the coeffiecient of the $x^2$ is 1
- Take out a common factor first so that the quadratic expression can then be factorised into a binomial product
- A quadratic expression is an algebraic expression in which the highest power of the variable is 2
- It is somtimes called a quadratic trinomial as it as 3 terms, for example $$x^2 - 4x + 6$$ $$3^2 + 6x - 12$$$$-x^2 + 6x$$

#### Examples
- $(x+3)(x+5) = x^2 + 5x + 3x + 15$
- = $x^2 + 8x + 15$
