## Adding and subtracting terms and substitution
- Only **like terms** can be added or subtracted
- Identify the like terms below:
$$4x, 6y, 8x^2, x, 12x$$
The like terms are: 4x, x, 12x
$$7y, 5xy, 12xy, 2x, 3.4xy$$
The like terms are: 5xy, 12xy, 3.4xy

### Adding and Subtracting terms
- Simplify the following $$8xy + 3xy + 12xy = 23xy$$ You add all of the like terms together, in this case, it is xy
$$4a + 5b -2a + 6b = 2a + 11b$$
	In this example above, you find the like terms and add them together. The same goes with subtraction $$6m - 2m^2 - 8m^2 - 4m = 2m - 10m^2$$
