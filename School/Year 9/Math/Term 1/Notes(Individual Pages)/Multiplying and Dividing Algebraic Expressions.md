- Multiply or divide the numbers first
- Then multiply or divide the variables
- Reminder: We usually write the variables in alphabetical order $$2x * 3y = 6xy$$ $$8xy * 3x = 24x^2y$$ $$-3m * (-2n) = 6mn$$
#### Example
- Write a simplified algebraic expression for the area for each shape
- Triangle with height of 4p and base of 6y (Area of triangle is $A = \dfrac{1}{2} * b * h$)
- $A = \dfrac {1}{2} * 6y *4p$  = $12yp$
- Tidy it up so it becomes $12py$
