## Factorising quadratic expressions in the form of $x^2 + bx + c$
- Factorising quadratic expressions which have a coefficient of $x^2$ that is not 1
- When the coefficient of $x^2$ is not 1, it is called a <u>non-monic</u> quadratic expression.
- Monic is when the coefficient of the term is the highest degree(in this case $x^2$) is equal to 1

- When the coefficient of $x^2$ is not a common factor, we have to use a different technique to factorise. 
- We do this by splitting the middle term into 2 terms and factorising by grouping in pairs [[Factorising special binomial products]]
- Find two numbers that have a sum of $b$ and a product of $c$
- Use these two numbers to write a binomial product of the form $(x ±  number)(x ± number )

#### Examples
- $x^2 + 12x + 35$
- Two numbers with a product of 35 and a sum of 12 
- They are 7 and 5
- $x^2 + 12x + 35 = (x+7)(x+5)$
