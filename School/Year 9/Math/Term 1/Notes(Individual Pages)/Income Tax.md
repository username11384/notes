## Income Tax (yayyyyy everyone's favourite)
- Anyone who earns more than $18200 a financial year must pay income tax to the federal government (goddamn it government)
- Income includes money earned from a job or interest earned from bank accounts and shares.
- The government uses the money paid in tax to fund publuc services such as schools, hospitals, roads and the defence force.
- Income tax is calculated based on a person's taxable income using the following formula: Taxable income = gross income - deductions
- A person's gross income is the total of all their earnings

So.. What are the deductions(this is **not** a tip for tax evasion btw)
- Not all of a person's income is taxed. There are allowable deductions(or tax deductions), which are not taxed, as the name suggests.
- They may include the following, charity donations, tools of trade(things to help you with work), subscriptions to professional organisations and journals.

### Tax Table
| **Taxable Income** | **Tax on this income**                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0-$18200           | Nil                                      |
| $18201-$37000      | 19c for each $1 over $18200              |
| $37001-$80000      | $3572 plus 32.5c for each $1 over $37000 |
| $80001-$180000     | $17547 plus 37c for each $1 over $80000  |
| $180001 and over   | $54547 plus 45c for each $1 over $180000 |

#### Examples
- Jake works as a plumber and earned $73219 this year. He is entitled to these deductions:
> Tools: $527.40
> Training courses: $735.26
> Office supplies: $321.55
- What is Jake's takaxble income rounded down to the nearest dollar?
- Total Deductions = 527.40 + 735.26 + 321.55 = $1584.21
- Taxable income = total income - deductions
- Taxable income = 73219 - 1584.21 = $71634.27
- YOU **ALWAYS ROUND DOWN** so the answer is $71634

- Rebecca earns $1756.55 per week and claims deductions of $455.30 in travel expenses, $276 in depreciation of computer equipment and $135.85 membership to a professional association. She also donated $30 each month to a charity. Calcuate Rebecca's:
- Gross annual income, taxable income, income tax payable
- Gross annual income = 1756.55 x 52 = $91340.60
- Deductions = 455.40 + 276 + 135.85 + 30 x 12(12 months in a year) = $1227.15
- Taxable income = 91340 - 1227.15 = $90113.45
- YOU **ALWAYS ROUND DOWN** so the answer is $90113

- Tax payable = 17547 + 0.37 x 10113 = $21228.81
How do you calculate this? You find where Rebecca's pay lands on the Tax table, which is in the $80001-$180000 range. You get the base tax($17547) and add 37c for each dollar over $80000, which she is $10113 over $80000
