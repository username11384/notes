## Commission, Piecework and Leave Loading
- Piecework is earned according to the number of items made or tasks completed e.g pamphlets delivered, items stitched
- Annual leave loading or holiday loading is extra pay given during annual leave. It is paid at 175% of 4 weeks pay.
- Commission is a percentage of what someone sells. Something else given with a commission is a retainer. A retainer is a base amount paid regardless what you sell. Commission workers are real estate agents or car salesperson

#### Examples
- John is a car salesman and is paid a commission of 5% on the value of the cars he sells. He also recieves a weekly retainer of $250. How much will John earn if he sells a car for $46000
- John will recieve $2550. This is worked out by multiplying $46000 by 0.05(which is 5%) and adding the $250 retainer to it. This should equal $2300(commission) + $250(retainer)
