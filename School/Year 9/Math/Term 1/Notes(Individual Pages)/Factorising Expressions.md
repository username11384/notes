## Factorising Expressions (i don't think it is in the exam)
- Expanding and factorising are inverse operations
- Expanding is removing the brackets and factorising is inserting brackets
- To factorise an expression, you need to:
- Find the HCF(Highest common factor) of the terms and write it outside the brackets
- Divide each term by the HCF and write the answers inside the brackets: $ab + ac = a(b+c)$ and $ab - ac = a(b-c)$
- To check that the factorised anwer is correct, expand it

#### Examples
- $x^2 + x = x(x+1)$
- $15y + 10 = 5(3y+2)$
