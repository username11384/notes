## Wages and salaries
- A wage is calculated from the number of hours worked and is usually paid weekly. Examples of this are retail workers, gardeners and factory workers.
- Wage earners can make some more income by working more hours(overtime)
- A salary is a fixed annual amount, paid weekly, fortnightly or monthly. Examples of this are teachers, managers, architects, police etc. 
- Salary earners do not earn overtime pay but they can recieve benefits such as a computer, company account, expense account, shares in the company or paid medical expenses

Conversion rate:
1 year = 12 months
1 fortnight = 2 weeks
1 year = 52 weeks(not exactly, a real year is 52.18 weeks for salary earners)
1 year = 26 fortnights
1 month is **NOT** 4 weeks.

#### Examples
- John earns a salary of $43,550 p.a. (which stands for per annum, per year). How much(round to nearest cent) does he earn?
- a) each week = $837.5
- b) each fortnight = $1675
- c) each month = $3629.17

- Jenny earns $659 a week. What is her annual wage?
- $34268(multiply $659 by 52 weeks)

---
## Overtime pay
- There are multiple types of overtime pay in Australia. There is double time, and time and a half. Double time is 200% of your pay and time and a half is 150% of your pay
- You get paid depending on what your employer says and when you work outside of your time schedule. For example, you work in McDonalds from 10am to 4pm, and your manager needs you to stay until 6pm. They will pay you overtime for this. 
- Overtime pay **does not** affect salary workers.

#### Examples
- Michael works for 35 hours a week with an hourly rate of $18.50. If he works 6 hours overtime at time and a half for 2 hours overtime at double time, what is his pay for the week
- Pay for the week = $883.2. You figure this out by multiplying $18.50 by 35 hours to get his base weekly pay. And then you do 6 x 18.50 x 1.5 to figure out his time and a half pay. You add the together to get $883.2

---
## Commission, Piecework and Leave Loading
- Piecework is earned according to the number of items made or tasks completed e.g pamphlets delivered, items stitched
- Annual leave loading or holiday loading is extra pay given during annual leave. It is paid at 175% of 4 weeks pay.
- Commission is a percentage of what someone sells. Something else given with a commission is a retainer. A retainer is a base amount paid regardless what you sell. Commission workers are real estate agents or car salesperson

#### Examples
- John is a car salesman and is paid a commission of 5% on the value of the cars he sells. He also recieves a weekly retainer of $250. How much will John earn if he sells a car for $46000
- John will recieve $2550. This is worked out by multiplying $46000 by 0.05(which is 5%) and adding the $250 retainer to it. This should equal $2300(commission) + $250(retainer)

---
## Income Tax (yayyyyy everyone's favourite)
- Anyone who earns more than $18200 a financial year must pay income tax to the federal government (goddamn it government)
- Income includes money earned from a job or interest earned from bank accounts and shares.
- The government uses the money paid in tax to fund publuc services such as schools, hospitals, roads and the defence force.
- Income tax is calculated based on a person's taxable income using the following formula: Taxable income = gross income - deductions
- A person's gross income is the total of all their earnings

So.. What are the deductions(this is **not** a tip for tax evasion btw)
- Not all of a person's income is taxed. There are allowable deductions(or tax deductions), which are not taxed, as the name suggests.
- They may include the following, charity donations, tools of trade(things to help you with work), subscriptions to professional organisations and journals.

### Tax Table
| **Taxable Income** | **Tax on this income**                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0-$18200           | Nil                                      |
| $18201-$37000      | 19c for each $1 over $18200              |
| $37001-$80000      | $3572 plus 32.5c for each $1 over $37000 |
| $80001-$180000     | $17547 plus 37c for each $1 over $80000  |
| $180001 and over   | $54547 plus 45c for each $1 over $180000 |

#### Examples
- Jake works as a plumber and earned $73219 this year. He is entitled to these deductions:
> Tools: $527.40
> Training courses: $735.26
> Office supplies: $321.55
- What is Jake's takaxble income rounded down to the nearest dollar?
- Total Deductions = 527.40 + 735.26 + 321.55 = $1584.21
- Taxable income = total income - deductions
- Taxable income = 73219 - 1584.21 = $71634.27
- YOU **ALWAYS ROUND DOWN** so the answer is $71634

- Rebecca earns $1756.55 per week and claims deductions of $455.30 in travel expenses, $276 in depreciation of computer equipment and $135.85 membership to a professional association. She also donated $30 each month to a charity. Calcuate Rebecca's:
- Gross annual income, taxable income, income tax payable
- Gross annual income = 1756.55 x 52 = $91340.60
- Deductions = 455.40 + 276 + 135.85 + 30 x 12(12 months in a year) = $1227.15
- Taxable income = 91340 - 1227.15 = $90113.45
- YOU **ALWAYS ROUND DOWN** so the answer is $90113

- Tax payable = 17547 + 0.37 x 10113 = $21228.81
How do you calculate this? You find where Rebecca's pay lands on the Tax table, which is in the $80001-$180000 range. You get the base tax($17547) and add 37c for each dollar over $80000, which she is $10113 over $80000

--- 
## PAYG and Net Pay
- Net pay is gross pay - tax - other deductions
- PAYG Tax is when tax is taken out of your paycheck every time you get paid, so you don't need to pull out a large sum of money when tax comes around.

### PAYG Tax Table
| **Weekly Earnings($)** | **PAYG tax withheld** |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| 184-188                | 40                    |
| 189-192                | 41                    |
| 193-197                | 42                    |
| 198-201                | 43                    |
| 202-206                | 44                    |

#### Examples
- During his uni holidays, Adam worked in a factory outlet store and earned $196 per week for 8 weeks.
- a) Calculate Adam's gross income for the 8 weeks
- Gross income = 196 x 8 = $1568
- b) How much PAYG tax was deducted from his pay over the 8 weeks?
- PAYG tax = 42 x 8 = $336 (Calculate this using the tax table above)

## Adding and subtracting terms and substitution
- Only **like terms** can be added or subtracted
- Identify the like terms below:
$$4x, 6y, 8x^2, x, 12x$$
The like terms are: 4x, x, 12x
$$7y, 5xy, 12xy, 2x, 3.4xy$$
The like terms are: 5xy, 12xy, 3.4xy

### Adding and Subtracting terms
- Simplify the following $$8xy + 3xy + 12xy = 23xy$$ You add all of the like terms together, in this case, it is xy
$$4a + 5b -2a + 6b = 2a + 11b$$
	In this example above, you find the like terms and add them together. The same goes with subtraction $$6m - 2m^2 - 8m^2 - 4m = 2m - 10m^2$$
--- 

## Multiplying and Dividing Algebraic Expressions

- Multiply or divide the numbers first
- Then multiply or divide the variables
- Reminder: We usually write the variables in alphabetical order $$2x * 3y = 6xy$$ $$8xy * 3x = 24x^2y$$ $$-3m * (-2n) = 6mn$$
#### Examples
- Write a simplified algebraic expression for the area for each shape
- Triangle with height of 4p and base of 6y (Area of triangle is $A = \dfrac{1}{2} * b * h$)
- $A = \dfrac {1}{2} * 6y *4p$  = $12yp$
- Tidy it up so it becomes $12py$ 

---

## Algebraic Fractions and expanding expressions

- To add or subract fractions, convert them(if needed) so that they will have the same denominator, then simply add or subract the numerators(top one)
- $\dfrac {2a}{7} + \dfrac {3a}{7} = \dfrac {5a}{7}$

#### Examples
$\dfrac {a}{2} + \dfrac {a}{5} = \dfrac {5a}{10} + \dfrac {2a}{10}$

--- 

## Multiplying and dividing algebraic fractions
- To multiply fractions, cancel any common factors, then multiply the numerators and denominators seperately. 
- To divide by a fraction $\dfrac {a}{b}$, multiply by its reciprocal $\dfrac {b}{a}$

#### Examples
- $\dfrac {3}{h} * \dfrac {5}{k}$ = $\dfrac {3 * 5}{h * k}$ 
                  = $\dfrac {15}{hk}$
- $\dfrac {k}{2} \div \dfrac {k}{8}$ =  $\dfrac {k}{2} * \dfrac {8}{k}$
				    = $\dfrac {8k}{2k}$
- Cancel out any common factors = $\dfrac {4}{1}$

---

## Expanding Expressions
The distributive law for expanding an expression
- Multiply each term inside the brackets by the term outside
- $a(b + c) = ab + ac$
- $a(b - c) = ab - ac$

#### Examples
- $4(5 + d) = 4* 5 + 4 * d$
                  = $20d + 4d$
- $3g(h-2) = 3gh - 6g$

--- 

## Factorising Expressions (i don't think it is in the exam)
- Expanding and factorising are inverse operations
- Expanding is removing the brackets and factorising is inserting brackets
- To factorise an expression, you need to:
- Find the HCF(Highest common factor) of the terms and write it outside the brackets
- Divide each term by the HCF and write the answers inside the brackets: $ab + ac = a(b+c)$ and $ab - ac = a(b-c)$
- To check that the factorised anwer is correct, expand it

#### Examples
- $x^2 + x = x(x+1)$
- $15y + 10 = 5(3y+2)$

---

## Expanding Binomial Products
- $(k+4)$ and $(k-6)$ are called **binomial expressions** because each expression has exactly two terms (binomial = '2 terms').
- $(k+4)(k-6) is called a **binomial product** because it is a product(multiplication) of two binomial expressions
- When expanding a binomial product algebraically, each term in the first binomial is multiplied by each term in the second binomial to give **four terms**, which are collected and simplified. 
- $(k+4)(k=6) = k(k-6) + 4(k-6)$
- = $k^2 - 6k + 4k - 24$
- = $k^2 - 2k - 24$
- One way of remembering which pair of terms multiply together is the FOIL method. 
- F - First
- O - Outside
- I - Inside
- L - Last

--- 

## Perfect Squares
- 16, 36, $a^2$ and $(y+2)^2$ are called perfect squares because they are square numbers.
- The rule for expanding the perfect square of a binomial is:
- $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$
- $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$

#### Examples
- $(a+b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b)$
- = $a(a+b)+b(a+b)$
- = $a^2 + ab + ba + b^2$
- = $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$

----

## Difference of two squares
- The answer is called the **difference of two squares** Rule:
- $(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$

#### Examples
- Expand and simplify each of the follwing:
- $(x+2)(x-2) = x^2 + 2x - 2x - 4$
- = $x^2 - 4$
- $(x+7)(x-7) = x^2 + 7x - 7x - 49$
- = $x^2 - 49$

## Factorising special binomial products
- Algebraic expressions with four terms can often be factorised in pairs, i.e. two terms at a time, to make a binomial product
- $10x^2 + 30 + x^3 + 3x = 10(x^2 + 3) + x(x^2 + 3)$
- = $(x^2 + 3)(10 + x)$

- $x^3 + 10x^2 + 3x + 30 = x^2(x+10) + 3(x+10)$
- = $(x+10)(x^2+3)$

--- 

## Factorising quadratic expressions
- Factorise a quadratic expression to form a binomial product when the coeffiecient of the $x^2$ is 1
- Take out a common factor first so that the quadratic expression can then be factorised into a binomial product
- A quadratic expression is an algebraic expression in which the highest power of the variable is 2
- It is somtimes called a quadratic trinomial as it as 3 terms, for example $$x^2 - 4x + 6$$ $$3^2 + 6x - 12$$$$-x^2 + 6x$$

- ![[Pasted image 20220329155934.png]]
#### Examples
- $(x+3)(x+5) = x^2 + 5x + 3x + 15$
- = $x^2 + 8x + 15$

---

## Factorising quadratic expressions in the form of $x^2 + bx + c$
- Factorising quadratic expressions which have a coefficient of $x^2$ that is not 1
- When the coefficient of $x^2$ is not 1, it is called a <u>non-monic</u> quadratic expression.
- Monic is when the coefficient of the term is the highest degree(in this case $x^2$) is equal to 1

- When the coefficient of $x^2$ is not a common factor, we have to use a different technique to factorise. 
- We do this by splitting the middle term into 2 terms and factorising by grouping in pairs [[Factorising special binomial products]]
- Find two numbers that have a sum of $b$ and a product of $c$
- Use these two numbers to write a binomial product of the form $(x ±  number)(x ± number )

#### Examples
- $x^2 + 12x + 35$
- Two numbers with a product of 35 and a sum of 12 
- They are 7 and 5
- $x^2 + 12x + 35 = (x+7)(x+5)$
