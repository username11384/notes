The Industrial Revolution took place in Britain in the 18th century. (1760-1840 approx). It changed the way that things were produced

The significance of the Industrial Revolution was the growth of the European population, the peasants became workers and there was more world trade and global contracts being made

The bourgeoisie were the factory owners and the proletariat were the workers

British convicts were sent to America and Australia

The reasons for European imperial expansion were
- Nationalism - Owning colonies was a sign of strength and wealth
- Economics - The Industrial Revolution made demand for raw supplies and trade
- Security - Overseas control helped with times of conflict(war)

The First Fleet arrived at Port Jackson on the 26th January 1788

Terra Nullius is a latin word that means land belonging to no one

Australia's first Prime Minister was Sir Edmund Barton, on the 1st of Jan 1901

The settlement at Port Jackson struggled to survive due to the poor quality of the soil and the fact that the climate was different to the climate in England, and the convicts didn't know how to farm

The sheep destroyed the environment by their hooves, and their jaw structure made them destroy the roots of the grass.

Missions were established to convert Indigenous people to Christianity from their “pagen” beliefs. If Indigenous Australians converted, the Europeans would provide them with places to live and protection for other European attacks.

The Blue Mountains were crossed in 1815

## Living and Working Conditions
---
### Life for Men, Women and Children
Men worked hard and dangerous jobs to earn little, they also had more freedom than women and were the main breadwinners. Women were usually at home doing domestic work such as cleaning up or making food, they also had less rights than men. Children received education and were put to work as soon as they could to provide for their family.

### Living Conditions
For the rich, life was extravagant. They had large homes with beautiful gardens and had many servants who would tend to their every need. They were also provided with sewerage and plumbing in their home as they could easily afford it.

For the poor, they lived in cramped 1 room houses made with cheap materials with hardly any insulation to speak of. These houses were constructed near factories, so that workers (every lower-class male) could commute to work more easily. They also had no plumbing or sewerage as they could not afford it, toilets were generally buckets in small sheds. The waste would then be taken away by “nightmen” at specific times. And to make things worse, due to this poor living, the likelihood of getting a disease (whooping cough, tuberculosis) skyrocketed.

### Leisure Activities
The working class had no radio and no TV or movies. On Saturday afternoons however, the working class would go to horse races, football matches or a trip to the beach if they could afford a tram.

For middle class people; they could go to musical, opera, picnics card parties and most middle class people had a piano in their house for ‘sing along’.

Upper class people would usually have a tennis court on their property, which they would use periodically for tennis parties. Local race meetings were also organized.

### Jobs available for both men and women
Jobs that both men and women had access to jobs such as Teaching, Retail work, Bank work (management) and medical based fields.

### Who was education available for?
Children between the ages of 6 and 13 years old had compulsory education in ALL Australian colonies by 1900. These laws were not strictly enforced, mainly in secluded communities. Compulsory schooling was only enforced onto European people, not Indigenous children. Many children from poor families (as said before) were expected to go into work as soon as they could to provide for their family, education wasn't their main priority.

Children from richer families attended private schools, this gave girls better learning opportunities as they learn literature, music and/or french (this was paired with how to be a housewife). Boys were encouraged to pursue higher education in universities to have proper training within a profession.
