# People with disabilities

Why are they discriminated against?
- They may not seem "normal" to others
- Mental issues are often looked down on


Lachlan will be the not so nice gym teacher that spins the whistle around, and discriminates against physically challenged individuals. 

Immanuel will be the physically challenged individual.

Teacher will tell students to do 100m sprint, but doesn't cater for the student who could be in a wheelchair, or that couldn't run on the grass. 

This keeps going(find more examples)

Teacher gets fired, new teacher arrives and resolves everything
