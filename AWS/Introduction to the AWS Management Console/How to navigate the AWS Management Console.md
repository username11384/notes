[[Introduction to the AWS Management Console]]
Go back to course objectives

Everything in the AWS Management Console is grouped by categories. Commonly used services are Compute, Storage, Database, Networking and Security. 

You may need to use [[EC2]](Elastic Compute Cloud) and Lambda often, so they are easy to find at the top of the page. 

Scrolling down will find Amazon [[S3]](Simple Storage Service), which is used to store files at high scalability and performance

Amazon [[RDS]](Relational Database Service) allows you to scale databases almost instantly, and is recommended for most users, unless you use a non-relational database, which you can use [[DynamoDB]]
